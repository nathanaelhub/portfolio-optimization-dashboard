## Basic Optimization

### Your First Optimization

1. **Select a Portfolio**
   - Choose an existing portfolio or create a new one
   - Ensure you have at least 2 assets (recommend 3-10 for beginners)

2. **Choose Optimization Method**

   **Maximum Sharpe Ratio** (Recommended for beginners)
   - Finds the best risk-adjusted returns
   - Balances return and risk automatically
   - Good starting point for most investors

   **Minimum Volatility**
   - Focuses on reducing portfolio risk
   - Suitable for conservative investors
   - May sacrifice some return for stability

   **Risk Parity**
   - Each asset contributes equally to portfolio risk
   - Good diversification across different market conditions
   - Less dependent on return predictions

3. **Set Constraints** (Optional)
   ```
   Maximum single asset weight: 40%
   Minimum single asset weight: 5%  
   Maximum sector concentration: 30%
   ```

4. **Run Optimization**
   - Click the "Optimize Portfolio" button
   - Wait for calculations to complete (usually < 10 seconds)
   - Review the recommended allocation

### Understanding Optimization Settings

**Risk-Free Rate**
- Default: 2% (approximate T-bill rate)
- Used for Sharpe ratio calculations
- Higher rates favor less risky portfolios

**Historical Data Period**
- Default: 3 years of daily data
- Longer periods: More stable but less responsive
- Shorter periods: More responsive but potentially noisy

**Rebalancing Frequency**
- How often to review and adjust allocations
- More frequent = better tracking but higher costs
- Consider your investment amount and transaction fees

### Advanced Settings

**Estimation Methods**
- **Sample Statistics**: Uses historical mean and covariance
- **Shrinkage Estimators**: Reduces estimation error
- **Robust Methods**: Less sensitive to outliers

**Risk Models**
- **Sample Covariance**: Standard approach
- **Factor Models**: Uses market, size, and value factors
- **EWMA**: Exponentially weighted moving average

## Interpreting Results

└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Metrics Explained

**Expected Annual Return**
- Predicted yearly return based on historical data
- Remember: Past performance doesn't guarantee future results
- Higher is generally better, but consider the risk

**Annual Volatility** 
- Measure of return variability (risk)
- 15% volatility means returns typically vary by ±15% from the average
- Lower values indicate more stable investments

**Sharpe Ratio**
- Risk-adjusted return measure
- Higher values are better (>1.0 is good, >2.0 is excellent)
- Compares excess return to risk taken

**Maximum Drawdown**
- Largest peak-to-trough decline historically
- Helps you understand potential losses
- Important for setting realistic expectations

### Allocation Changes

**Green Arrows (↑)**: Increase allocation
- Algorithm recommends buying more of this asset
- Often indicates undervalued or low-correlation assets

**Red Arrows (↓)**: Decrease allocation  
- Algorithm recommends reducing this position
- May indicate overvaluation or high correlation with other holdings

**Magnitude of Changes**
- Small changes (< 5%): Minor rebalancing
- Large changes (> 10%): Significant strategy shift
- Consider transaction costs when implementing

### Risk Analysis

**Diversification Benefits**
- Compare single-asset risk to portfolio risk
- Good diversification significantly reduces total risk
- Look for correlation matrix to understand relationships

**Stress Testing**
- See how portfolio performed during market crashes
- Examples: 2008 Financial Crisis, COVID-19 pandemic, Dot-com bubble
- Helps set realistic expectations for difficult periods

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Optimization Failed" Error
- **Cause**: Infeasible constraints (e.g., min weights too high)
- **Solution**: Relax constraints or add more assets

### Unrealistic Results
- **Cause**: Insufficient historical data or extreme market conditions
- **Solution**: Use longer data periods or robust estimation methods

### High Turnover Recommendations
- **Cause**: Noisy data or frequent rebalancing
- **Solution**: Add turnover constraints or use less frequent rebalancing

### Unexpected Asset Allocations
- **Cause**: Algorithm found genuine diversification benefits
- **Solution**: Check correlations and consider the optimization objective
